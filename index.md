_It's no Isengard, but you Lords are welcomed nontheless!_

We wanted to make a page that was:
* Isolated from canvas to be  more easily accessible
* Introduced TAs on a more casual basis
* Looked like it was made by a 4th grader 
** (Coded by Grad Students!! have some fun TRY!!) 
* Was regularly updated enough...

### _If you would like, feel free to send them a video letting them know who you are!_
