_Hey there! Welcome! Please check us out!_

We wanted to make a page that was:
* accesable to all students 
* isolated from canvas in a way that was easily accesable
* looked like it was made by a 4th grader 
** (Coded by Grad Students!! have some fun and TRY IT!!) 
* Regularly updated enough...

# Click on the TA images below to access videos (90 seconds) introducing a TA
  - Get some information on the courses they teach.
  - Learn a little about who they are. 

# If you would like, feel free to send a video to them letting them know who you are!
