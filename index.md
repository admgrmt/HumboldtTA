_Hey there! Welcome! Please check us out!_

We wanted to make a page that was:
* Accesible to all students 
* Isolated from canvas in a way that was easily accessible
* Looked like it was made by a 4th grader 
** (Coded by Grad Students!! have some fun TRY!!) 
* Regularly updated enough...

## Click on the images below to access videos _(90 seconds)_ introducing each TA
  - Get some information on the courses they teach.
  - Learn a little about who they are. 

### _If you would like, feel free to send them a video letting them know who you are!_
